1. d) StackOverflowError: The recursive method recurse calls itself so many times that 
	 the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call 
	 is more than can fit on the stack. 
	 There is no also base case in the recursive function. The base case should have included 
	  when the string is empty or with length one. Null string doesn't mean empty string.
	 
	 Thus, the recursive method keeps calling it self without termination case.
	 
2.  d) StackOverflowError: As in the above question it generates a stack overflow exception.
	
	Here in the code there is no way that the self code leads to base case. 
	Because it keeps permutating without reducing the string to base case.
